# EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

## EC2 101
A web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

Reduces time required to boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

### EC2 Pricing Models
1. On Demand
    * Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
2. Reserved
    * Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on hourly charges for an instance.
    * Contract Terms are 1 Year or 3 Years Terms.
3. Spot
    * Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capcacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
4. Dedicated Hosts
    * Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use.
    * Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software liscenses.

### On Demand Pricing
For users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment

Good for applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that can not be interrupted.

Also good for applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.

### Reserved Pricing
Good for applicatins with steady state or predictable usage.

Applications that require reserved capacity

Users are able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further

Comes in three types:
1. Standard Reserved Instances
    * Offer up to 75% off on demand instances. They longer the term and more up front, the greater the discount.
2. Convertible Reserved Instances:
    * Off up to 54% off on demand with capability to convert to a different instance type of equal or greater value.
3. Scheduled Reserved Instances
    * These are available to launch within the time windows you reserve, allowing you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule

### Spot Pricing
Useful for applications with flexible start and end times.

Only good for applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices

Also good for users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.

### Dedicated Hosting Pricing
Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.

Great for liscensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.

Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly), or as a Reservatrion for up to 70% off the On-Demand price.

Know the EC2 Pricing Options

Also - if the Spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. Howerver, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran.

## EC2 Instance Launch Lab - Exam Tips
Termination protection is **turned off* by default, you must turn it on yourself.

On an EBS-backed instance, the **default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted** when the instance is terminated.
    * Any additional volumes, ny defualt, won't be.

EBS Root Volumes of your DEFAULT AMI's **CAN** now be encrypted. You can also use a third party tool to encrypt the root volume or this can be done when creating AMI's in the AWS console or using the API.
* Additional volumes can also be encrypted.

## Security Groups Lab - Exam Tips
All inbound traffic is blocked by default and sll outbound traffic is allowed.
* This is because Security Groups are STATEFUL.

Changes to Security Groups take effect immediately.

You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group,
and you can have multiple security groups attached to an EC2 instances.

You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use Network Access Control Lists.

You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.

## EBS 101
What is EBS?

Elastic Block Store - it is a virtual hard disk in the cloud. 

Comes in 5 general flavors:
* General Purpose (SSD)
    * Use cases - most work loads
    * API name is gp2 - suitable for workloads up to 16,000 IOPS/volume
* Provisioned IOPS (SSD) - highest performnce SSD volume designed for mission-critical appliations
    * Use cases - Databases
    * API name is io1 - capable o fup to 64,000 IOPS 
* Throughput Optimized Hard Disk Drive
    * st1
    * 500 IOPS
    * Used for big data in data warehousing
* Cold Hard Disk Drive - lowest cost for HDD
    * sc1
    * Less frequently accessed workloads such as File servers
    * 250 IOPS
* Magnetic
    * Previous generation HDD
    * 40-200 IOPS

## EBS Volumes & Snapshots Lab - Exam Tips
Volumes exist on EBS, which you can think of as a virtual hard drive.

Snapshots exist on S3. Think of snapshots as a photograph of the disk.
* Snapshots are point in time copies of volumes.
* Snapshots are incremental, this means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3.
* If it is your first snapshot it may take some time to create.

It is best practice that when taking a snapshot of a volume that serves as the root device, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.
* However you can take a snapshot while an instance is running.

You can create AMI's from Snapshots

You can change EBS volume sizes on the fly, including changing the size and storage type.

Volumes will ALWAYS be in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance.

To move an EC2 volume from one AZ to another, take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then use the AMI to launch the EC2 instance in a new AZ.

Likewise, to move an EC3 volume from one region to another, take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then copy the AMI from one region to another. Then use the copied AMI to launch the new EC2 instance in the new region.
